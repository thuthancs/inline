# Why inline?
As someone who reads online most of the time, I find the **current reading flow annoying and requires too much switching**. 
When I read, I want to engage AND save information so that I can revisit it later. 
Now, all of my data lives in Notion, and whenever I read a research paper or something that requires serious attention, I need to open a split view, copy from one tab, paste it into Notion, and open another tab, like Claude or ChatGPT, to ask follow-up questions. 
I was thinking about how I can automate this process so that my online reading experience is more seamless while ensuring the right information is saved to my knowledge base. And this is why **inline** was born :)
